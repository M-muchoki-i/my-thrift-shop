  THE MM'S THRIFT SHOP PROJECT.


  This project deals with the frontend of software development: html,css and java script.ive also used json-server as my server to store the information being displayed.

  <!-- the Aim of this project -->
  my goal was that anyone can accesss my thrift shop and purchase the items displayed that captured their attention.This is a simple project that focuse more on the json-server and javascript,but its a good challenge since it test skills and knowledge like array iteration method ,(DOM manipulation) ,fetching(communicating with the server) and event listening to the inputs (event listening)

  i also used bootsarap to help me with css styling . and some of my styling in the style.css

  <!-- How i build my project -->

  The project was build from scratch.I i first dealt with the html part which contains an imput type and a placeholder to serch for the items, the div-container to store  the items that are going to be fetched from the server and manipulated at the java script .lastly a button to sort items by their price from smallest price to the largst price.

  <!-- css part -->

  i styled everything on my css to make it look more attractive.

  <!--java script part  -->
  
on the java script part i first fetched the data from the json-server,so as to display the items on my web page .i added an event listner to the purchase button so as once an item is purchased it temporarily disappears from the web page. i added an event listner mouseover so that depending on where someone is accessing the site they can mouse over each item .

<!-- json-server -->
this is where all the data was stored and fetched.
